# Hello-World
My first project
This here is my first time using GitHub. I really like this website so far. It has given me the opportunity to learn bit-by-bit without the pressure of not knowing how to code. I'm from Grand Bahama Island and I aspire to become a Data Scientist or Software Architect!
